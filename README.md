# hello-world
Just testing out this repository thing. 

Hello GitHub, I have known of you for a while, but I was content and comfortable with my old ways.
I would submerse myself in the filth of resaving my changes under a new file name 
until I was covered in darkness by the mountain of changes that my unworthy hands had created. 
One day when the wind was blowing hard enough that I could see light coming through the files I caught a glimpse of you. 
From my dark and distant corner of the web I didnâ€™t realize what I saw 
before the changes came crashing back around me again. 
I vowed that day to get back to the light. I stayed up late into the night battling the demons of my change mountain.
Slaying and hacking away at the beast before me I realized that I was fighting a hydra.
With each thrust of my keyboard I made another file. 
This evil change mountain grew the more I tried to fix it.

GitHub, I learned my lesson the hard way and I am ready to come out of the dark to fix my process. 
I have left the hydra frozen in place until I have mastered the skill of version control.
